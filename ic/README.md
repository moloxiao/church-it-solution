Here's the step-by-step guide in English on how to use Google Apps Script to share Google Sheets data in JSON format.   
1. **Create a Google Apps Script Project**

Open your Google Sheets document.  
Click on Extensions -> Apps Script.  
  
2. **Write the Google Apps Script Code**  

In the Apps Script editor, delete any existing code and add the following code:  
```
function doGet(e) {
  var sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().getActiveSheet();
  var data = sheet.getDataRange().getValues();
  var jsonData = JSON.stringify(data);
  return ContentService.createTextOutput(jsonData).setMimeType(ContentService.MimeType.JSON);
}
```

This script reads the data from the active sheet and returns it in JSON format.

3. **Deploy the Script as a Web App**

Click on Deploy -> New deployment.  
In the Select type dropdown, choose Web app.  
Under Who has access, select Anyone or Anyone with the link.  
Click Deploy.  
Authorize the script by following the prompts to allow necessary permissions.  
After deployment, copy the web app URL provided.
